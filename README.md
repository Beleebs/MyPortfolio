# My Portfolio Website
## Welcome! 
This project includes elements utilizing React, JS, CSS, Python, and much more. More of a passion design project than anything, I wanted to get better at making web applications

## Inspiration
I wanted to go for a dark Y2K style, similar to themes found in Sonic Adventure 2 and other games from that era. I wanted to incorporate the following aspects:
- Dynamic/Animated Background
- Page Transitions
- Button/Link Animations
- Other things that I think are cool that I can't think of right now 😆
